## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danieloquelis/drum-xr.git
   ```

2. Download [Passthrough Camera API Samples](https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-PassthroughCameraApiSamples) from Meta's official GitHub repository.

3. Place the **PassthroughCameraApiSamples** folder inside your project's `/Assets` directory.

4. Import the latest **Meta XR SDK (v76)** via Unity Package Manager or from Meta's developer portal (I used all in one SDK).

5. Make sure your Unity version is `6000.0.23f1`.

6. Open the `DrumScanScene` and replace the `RoboflowInference` prefabe values with your APIKeys and model.
